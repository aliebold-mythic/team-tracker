This app connects to the Google Sheet named 'Mission Month 2026 Tracker'. If the app crashes, check that the Service Account email (in Streamlit Secrets) is still an 'Editor' on that Sheet.

Privacy Note
Inputs are Private: Individual entries are hidden. No one else on the team can see that you specifically donated $50 or worked 2 hours.

Our Impact is Public: The dashboard only displays the Grand Totals (e.g., "Team Total: 150 Hours") so we can celebrate our progress together.
